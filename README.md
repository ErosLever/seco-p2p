Search Computing (Seco) is a project funded by the European Research Council (ERC), 
responding to the 2008 Call for "IDEAS Advanced Grants", a program dedicated to the 
support of investigation-driven frontier research.

The SeCo-p2p project starts as one of the possible assignments that students could 
chose for the Search Computing (2012 edition) course at Politecnico di Milano.

The goal of the seco-p2p project is to realise a distributed version of the SeCo 
platform.
