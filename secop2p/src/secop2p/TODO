below here will be all things that we have to do...and if someone wants work on
one of this points write near for example ( -> Andrea) and delete it if done...

1) Fix with try/catch Double immision of a Relation
   -> as trivial as "insert or replace ..."
      (see http://www.sqlite.org/lang_insert.html)

-2) Check whether service is local or not  -> Nguyen - DONE

-3) Implement Remote Invoker -> Nguyen

-4) Sending "I am alive" message -> Andrea

-5) TODO: + Register new engine/ service 
          + Request to ServiceRepository to get a local copy each hour

-6) Code cleanup for AliveTest: it's growing definetely too much,
    needs to be splitted into multiple files

-7) Metrics need to be reviewed, it does not make sense to set the own rtt.
